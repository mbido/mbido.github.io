window.markdownContent['about.md'] = `# About me

I am Matthieu Bidault, a Master 2 (M2) student in Computer Science at Sorbonne Université.

## My Master's program

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cryptography, High-Performance Computing, and Algorithms (CCA). This program focuses on advanced topics in secure computing, efficient algorithm design, and leveraging high-performance systems.

## My goals

I aim to complete my Master's degree and pursue a PhD that aligns with my interests.  
I particularly enjoy using high-performance computing as a tool and exploring the security and potential weaknesses of cryptographic systems.

window.markdownContent['projects/portfolio.md'] = `# Portfolio Terminal

This project is a fun way to present my skills, who i am in a terminal like environement.
It uses a bit of web technology with Xterm.js which help a lot doing the terminal emulation.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive CLI**: Explore content using commands like \`ls\`, \`cat\`, \`cd\`, \`tree\`.
- **Virtual File System**: Content is structured like a file system for an immersive experience.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Xterm.js for terminal emulation
- Python for compiling Markdown pages to static Javascript files.

SageMath implementation and study of the "Oil and Vinegar" (OV) and perturbed "OV $\widehat{+}$" post-quantum signature schemes.

This project was created for a Master's research course.

## What's Inside

  * **\`src/\`**: SageMath implementations.
      * \`OV/\`: The classic OV scheme, including the Kipnis-Shamir key forgery attack.
      * \`OV+/\`: The perturbed OV$hat(+)$ scheme, designed to be more secure.
  * **\`report/\`**: A detailed report (\`report.typ\`) with security analysis, complexity, and performance benchmarks.
  * **\`articles/\`**: The research papers this project is based on.
