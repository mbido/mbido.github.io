# Portfolio Terminal

This project is my personal portfolio, designed as an interactive terminal experience. It allows users to navigate through my skills, projects, and information about me using familiar command-line interface commands.

## Key Features:
- **Interactive CLI**: Explore content using commands like `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, `tree`.
- **Virtual File System**: Content is structured like a file system for an immersive experience.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Mimics real terminal behavior by fetching content on demand.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and functional across various devices.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Xterm.js for terminal emulation
