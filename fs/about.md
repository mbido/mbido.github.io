# About me

I am Matthieu Bidault, a Master 2 (M2) student in Computer Science at Sorbonne Universit√©.

## My Master's program

I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Cryptography, High-Performance Computing, and Algorithms (CCA). This program focuses on advanced topics in secure computing, efficient algorithm design, and leveraging high-performance systems.

## My goals

I aim to complete my Master's degree and pursue a PhD that aligns with my interests.  
I particularly enjoy using high-performance computing as a tool and exploring the security and potential weaknesses of cryptographic systems.
